Hacktoberfest, in its 8th year, is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean. During the month of October, we invite you to join open-source software enthusiasts, beginners, and the developer community by contributing to open-source projects. You can do this in a variety of ways:

- Prepare and share your project for collaboration

hope you follow this. I'll add your namme in contributors list as you start contibuting.

### 6. Commit Changes

Type following commands

```
git add .
git commit -m "message about commit"
```

### 7. Configure a Remote for the Fork

Next, you‚Äôll have to specify a new remote upstream repository for us to sync with the fork. This will be the original repository that you forked from. You‚Äôll have to do this with the `git remote add` command.

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ALLINONE4298/Hacktober2021.git
```

In this example, `upstream` is the shortname we have supplied for the remote repository since in terms of Git, ‚Äúupstream‚Äù refers to the repository that you cloned from. If you want to add a remote pointer to the repository of a collaborator, you may want to provide that collaborator‚Äôs username or a shortened nickname for the shortname.

### 8. Pull changes

To get latest code
Type following command

```
git pull upstream main
```

### 9. Push changes to Github

Type following command

```
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
```

### 10. Create Pull Request

At this point, you are ready to make a pull request to the original repository.

You should navigate to your forked repository, and press the ‚ÄúNew pull request‚Äù button on your left-hand side of the page.
